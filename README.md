## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

NoteBook is a blog application that lets users read posts on various topics. It uses GraphQL to query and manipulate data from a Strapi server, a headless CMS. The frontend interface is built with React and TypeScript, with Material UI for styling. NoteBook shows how to use these technologies together to make a modern and scalable web app.
